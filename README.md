## Project Description 

For this project we are creating an application to be used by companies for their managers and employees. This puts a system in place that allows for Feedback from the employees to go directly to corporate or the store owners on management, operations, scedualing and other possible recommendations a company or management can use to better suit everyday employees. Our Projects are on display via Github, with clickable images as well as my resume in a clickable PDF file.
